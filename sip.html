<h2><span>The Impact of Soybean Meal on The Growth of Ipomoea Batatas (Sweet Potatoes) </span></h2> <br>


<h3 style="color:#3B4A39">Background & Significance of the Study</h3>

<font size="5"> <p align="center" style="color:black">
Researching fertilizers is vital as it can greatly benefit many communities in a form of enhancing the gardening <br>
experience. By finding out which of the fertilizers is the most efficient we can help improve crop quality in rural <br>
areas and help anyone who’s interested in gardening. <br><br>

Our community Madrasah can be benefitted from our proposal as it can sustain better planting qualities, specifically <br>
on growing sweet potatoes or Ipomoea Batatas. Soybean meals are chosen as our initial fertilizer compost as they <br>
are compatible with sweet potatoes. They consist of vitamins that are essential in growing our chosen plant. We have <br>
chosen sweet potatoes as our plants as they are healthy and tasty, perfect for the beneficiaries in our partner institution <br>
to consume; and with our SIP proposal, we can better research more on how to grow these consumables effectively. <br>

<h3 style="color:#3B4A39">Statement of the Problem</h3>
<font size="5"> <p align="center" style="color:black">
We decided to launch this research to somehow enlighten or help our partnered institution “Madrasah” in terms of <br>
providing healthy food/snack to the advocacy. This study aims to better determine whether soybean meals used <br>
as fertilizer for sweet potatoes is a good idea in measuring how fast the plants can grow. With adequate research, we <br>
were able to find out how soybean meals are known to provide a lot of natural vitamins and minerals including <br>
phosphorus and nitrogen, which are what sweet potatoes mainly need to grow fast. With this research, we hope to see <br>
progress on how soybean meals will affect sweet potatoes so we can approve our hypothesis and conduct further <br>
action to help Madrasah. </p></font>
