<h2> Organizer </h2>
<font size="5"> <p align="center" style="color:#36454F"> 
The organization responsible for founding this school is the local government of Davao City <br>
and is currently being managed by the Department of Education (Dep-Ed). The reason for this <br>
is so the children in the area are able to have access to free or less expensive education. <br>
Education is a priority around the world however the Philippines is still a developing country <br>
and not everyone can have access to schools. So by having schools where the government pays <br>
for all the essentials all children can have access to education.

<h2> Benefactors </h2>
<font size="5"> <p align="center" style="color:#36454F"> 
The organization that provides support to the institution is the Department of Education. <br>
This helps the institution become more efficient by having more teachers and donators to <br>
help make the school more productive and make learning easier for the children. The <br>
teachers and students can also have more materials needed for their lessons like books, <br>
notebooks, pencils, ballpen, etc. so that they can teach more local and foreign students <br>
that live here in the Philippines. The students benefit from this because they can enhance <br>
their knowledge of their own culture despite being in another country and at the same <br>
time they can also learn about the culture of the Philippines.
