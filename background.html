				to sell so that we can use the funds to donate it to them. This project empowers them because this 
				can help them in finishing their school and have funds for the materials that they need for the students 
				to use in their academics. This will contribute ultimately to forming a community of productive citizens
				of the country by being more efficient in terms of business making and how it can benefit the partnered 
				institutions current problems and how it can also benefit the students that go to madrasah to learn. The 
				significance of our project proposal is the enrichment of the problems that our partnered institution is
				currently facing and how it can be solved. </p>
